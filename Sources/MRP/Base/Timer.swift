// Timers are used in the state machine descriptions in order to cause actions
// to be taken after defined time periods have elapsed. The following
// terminology is used in the state machine descriptions to define timer states
// and the actions that can be performed upon them:
//
// a) A timer is said to be running if the most recent action to be performed
// upon it was a start.
//
// b) A running timer is said to have expired when the time period associated
// with the timer has elapsed since the most recent start action took place.
//
// c) A timer is said to be stopped if it has expired or if the most recent
// action to be performed upon it was a stop action.
//
// d) A start action sets a stopped timer to the running state, and associates/
// a time period with the timer.  This time period supersedes any periods that/
// might have been associated with the timer by previous start events.
//
// e) A stop action sets a timer to the stopped state.
